1. How did you break down the design of the game into smaller, managable tasks?
2. How would you break it up so more than 1 person could work on it at a time?
3. How would you modify the game to make it replayable? (i.e. people want to keep coming back to it)
4. Summarize how your game works
5. Explain the structure of your design and why it's architected that way (i.e. classes and subclasses and such)
6. What do you think are the "next steps" for this game (e.g. improve code, add new features, idk)
7. Explain your process for developing the game
8. How would you monitize the game?
